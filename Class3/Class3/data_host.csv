2613,Rebecca,8/29/2008,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/2613,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","My 2 bdrm apartment is on the 2nd floor of a quiet, vintage co-op building, overlooking a pleasant courtyard.  I allow only one guest at a time, so you don't have to worry about other strangers in the apartment. (I occupy the 2nd bedroom).  A single, female traveler will feel safe and be comfortable here. If you are visiting the University of Chicago - or visiting your UChicago student who hasn't enough room to host you - my location will allow you to walk to your destination. My apartment is probably the Airbnb listing most convenient to the Chicago Theological Seminary. 

I realize that a lot of older people - like me - are hesitant about trying Airbnb, but you will be pleasantly surprised at how drama-free the experience can be. The key is to read the listings and reviews, then select only the ones that meets your safety, location, and comfort needs. Decide if you want an entire apartment or simply a private bedroom - like mine. Determine if you are comfortable with other travelers staying in the apartment or if you want to be the only guest during your visit - like my place. Airbnb hosts want you to enjoy your stay so read the entire listing (including the House Rules), look st the pictures and maps, and then ask any questions you may still have - before you book. 

Please let me know the purpose of your trip to Chicago so I can determine if my apartment or Hyde Park location is (or isn't) right for your visit.  I may even be able to suggest a more appropriate location. In any event, I will answer your inquiries quickly and honestly. "

We love this city, especially getting ribs at Twin Anchors in Old Town before a show at Second City. Wicker Park is a frequent hangout, where we tend to be pulled to the patio at Big Star, the bar at XOCO, and cocktails at Violet Hour. 

And free concerts at Pritzker Pavilion in Millenium Park can't be matched by any city in the world.

"" A person who is a master in the art of living makes little distinction between their work and their play, their labor and their leisure, their mind and their body, their education and their recreation, their love and their religion. They hardly know which is which and simply pursue their vision of excellence and grace, whatever they do, leaving others to decide whether they are working or playing. To them, they are always doing both.""

Having spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.  Many of my guests have been back 2 or 3 times, and some have found themselves venturing across the country to check out another Red Hot Vacation Rental.

I have always been interested in showing hospitality to others.  Before airbnb this was mostly done by inviting friends and others over to my home for dinner or cocktails....but I find it equally rewarding to be able to host a traveler and know that my home with influence their trip for the better.  

As I am getting older I have decided that I really want to travel and see more of the world...but limited finances (coupled with my refusal to sit int he back of planes) as well as a desire to really get to see how people live and just not how tourists are treated makes this a great option for me!  

I have quite a few different interests, but I am very into anything design related (architecture, shops, urban life) and am an avid collector of mid century furnishings and love modern art from around 1910 to 1960.  I am happy to have one black cat (I like cat's but one is just enough to keep it interesting) and love to entertain friends often.  I am also a sucker for British TV, and you will often find BBC America in the background.

I was lucky enough to have the New York Times recently devote two entire pages to me in their home section, making me sound much more interesting in print as compared with in reality and publishing some lovely pictures of my life.

Travel is my greatest passion, so far I've journeyed to China, Japan, France, Italy, Spain, England, Mexico, Canada, many beautiful islands and 49 of the 50 United States. My travel style is mostly independent, adventurous/spontaneous as I'm more inclined to seek the unbeaten path. Having said that, I toured China with a group of 20 people and really enjoyed the experience because we all bonded so well and China was simply amazing, it left an indelible impression on me..best trip ever. 

My motto is follow the Golden Rule ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". I expect my guests to be clean, courteous and respectful of me and house rules. In return, I will gladly and graciously welcome you to my home.

I'm a ""people-person"" from a family of world travelers; 4th generation Chicago cityboy with experience working in museums, hotels and ecolodges around the globe. 
Chicago history, architecture, and preservation are big interests of mine, and I take great pride in caring for the historic properties my family has lived in, owned & maintained for decades. 

I love AirBnb.  We have traveled, backpacked, hiked, camped, hoteled moteled, couch-surfed and home-shared... But AirBnb has been the single best thing to happen to us in our adult lives.

When we travel, we turn to AirBnb first, whether internationally, nationally, and in our own hometown.  From the glitzy new city experience to weekend trip to some small town in the country, we prefer staying with those in the AirBnb community.  The experience is always unique and always more authentic.

We are AirBnb hosts and consider it central to our lives here in Chicago.  Because my family lives in Chicago, one of us is always in the city, often while the rest of us travel. Any repairs are handled immediately. A while back, when I was moving from the building we own, we decided to open it for AirBnB guests. Now we have progressed to having vacation rentals within the building where we live.  Living nearby with my partner Alyssa allows us to keep in great touch with our guests, maintaining the gardens and accommodations ourselves, as well as hosting occasional art, music and dining events. 

I love this way of traveling and hosting; meeting the folks who come to stay with us is precisely what fuels me on the day-to-day, and it's what makes our vacations so much more enjoyable!  We've met hundreds of incredible people and stayed in fantastic homes across the world.  AirBnb has been such a great chapter in our lives!  :)"

Since then I've been to Scotland and am currently enamored with exploring the landscape of my native land and have taken several trips around the continental U.S. recently to explore the Pacific Northwest (but especially Oregon), scramble about the boulders and gawk at the Joshua trees in the Mohave Desert in California, and looking forward to tackling the topography in Utah soon.

We love to see the world and interact with interesting people from everywhere given that travel is our passion, having savored the rich aroma of stew in Ilorin, Nigeria.  Taken in the sunset with St. Lucia's Piton Mountains in the background. Climbed the steps of a Mayan Temple in Central America. Feasted on freshly caught lobster along Maine's southern coast.  Gazed upon the faraway valleys high up in the Andes from the heights of Manchu Picchu. 

These are only a few of the amazing places we've enjoyed together. 

We also take delight in great music and experiencing cuisines from around the world, in addition to hosting.  Of course, providing a unique guest experience takes a lot of work. For this reason, we have the help of Airbnb's Valorwings service which makes hosting fun and easy.  With Valorwings we believe it's possible that everyone can be a host.  

By the way, we highly recommend downloading Acehopper, Airbnb's ""front desk concierge"", to explore the area. Available for iPhone, iPad and Android devices, Acehopper has tickets, guides and tips on must-see places to visit. 

While our exciting careers keep us highly engaged and quite busy, we always find time to enjoy life and share experiences with the amazing people who choose to stay with us when we're at home. 

Thus far, we've had the privilege of hosting guests from Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and from all over the United States.

But here I am, 20 something years later, running a fabulous Greek vacation rental business with historic homes & penthouses in Athens, planning Greek travel itineraries and leading small group food & wine focused tours around my adopted homeland and loving the life that I am lucky enough to be living. Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: End of November 2017 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 15 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece ask us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so we're finally doing it - we've just completed the renovation of a fab old factory with 3 vacation rentals called the Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether we share an ouzo in Athens in our Acropolis View Alpha Plus penthouse or Sky Villa or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago, in our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed.

I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, avid hockey player and my right hand man.

I enjoy traveling, but it has been quite awhile ever since I had kids. Nowadays trips are geared around them and at places like Disney World. Places I've traveled in the past: Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Mexico, Canada, and continental US. While I loved all countries for a variety of reasons, I must say that Barcelona really resonated in my heart. The architecture, art, food, music, people, vibe, and ambiance felt like home to me. I will be sure to return there.

I am determined to hit Macchu Picchu in Peru in the summer of 2019. I'd like to eventually also hit Costa Rica, Thailand, India, and Australia. Oh yes, Galapagos Islands and Bali are certainly on my radar as well.

I love the Daily Show and I secretly still aspire to host my own talk show. I love NPR, The Young Turks, and reading books on my iPad/iPhone.

I love our city apartment- it allows me to moderate my bazillion hobbies from beer brewing on the back porch 5 gallons at a time to keeping a vertical herb garden with a shoe organizer. It's kind of like cooking, but with baby potatoes you know? Plus, it's an excellent excuse to have a cigar collection... because they're small.

I'm a collection of different things- in high school I was on the football team, but also a band geek.

1214607,Coral,9/27/2011,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1214607,"San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico","Hola! Thank you so much for taking the time to read a bit about myself. I will start out by saying that to me there's nothing like a good conversation. I love talking about geography, different cultures and even finances. 

My true passion is hosting. I would love to dedicate to it full time sooner rather than later. After having studied abroad for 3 years, more than taking myself around the world, I want to show Puerto Rico and Chicago to the world. If you're curious, I was born and raised in paradise: Puerto Rico!

I know how much guests value when a host personally welcomes them, however due to work and being between Puerto Rico and Chicago, unfortunately I'm not available to greet each guest personally. Regardless, I can guarantee that all my places will make you feel like at home. I have put a lot of effort and love into getting them setup. Each one of our listings (""our"" because my mom is the big helper) has been available for hosting after both my mom and I have stayed at each one and have approved them. We will say we are quite into the details; if you are too, I'm sure you'll notice.  

About me, I can't live without traveling, those deep conversations that by the end have made you question yourself and of course I most definitely can't live without Pancho! Pancho is my son (well, my dog) whom I just spoil too much. I rescued him from the streets of Puerto Rico and ever since we have been partners in crime. 

FOOD! Almost forgot about that one. Can't live without it! I love trying new dishes so if I'm around and you feel like cooking and exchanging recipes, let's do it! 

I love hosting guests that have positive vibes, are relaxed and know how to make the most out of every moment.

My favorite two board games are Mancala and Rummikub so if you think you can take a challenge, I'm more than willing to play! ;-)

I was formerly the Operations Manager for the Barbara Lynch Gruppo, an independent restaurant group in Boston and a company I worked with for 8 years. 

My involvement with Airbnb has grown organically, beginning in Boston after I left my job and posted my place in order in order to take advantage of my career gap and do some traveling. Ultimately I decided to move us to Chicago to be closer to family, and I started renting our Chicago apartment during our trips to Iowa City. These trips grew more and more frequent as both of my parents' health rapidly declined. Airbnb turned out to be a unique way to stay unemployed during this difficult family time. My mom passed away the fall after I started Airbnb, and my father a year later. 
 
I completed the Executive MBA program in the spring of 2016, and opened a coffee shop and several Airbnbs in Iowa City during my time there. I'm now happily settled with my son in Denver and loving every minute of the mountains!  

It's been an unusual journey and none of it would have been possible without Airbnb. I'm incredibly grateful that Airbnb has provided me with a way to spend as much time with my family as possible and to grow a unique and satisfying business; it has truly been a gift. I really look forward to sharing my spaces with you.

Cathy works full-time outside the house and Richard is semi-retired licensed clinical social worker and works as a consultant and short term family therapist.  When not working most of the time you'll find us working around the house and in our yard.  

We cherish our relationships with family members and friends - we love to study areas of interest - Richard plays guitar, Cathy and Richard like to draw, we enjoy walking our dogs, reading, meditating, cooking.  Cathy and Richard are both interested in politics and thought we don't think exactly alike most people would describe us as ""progressive.""

Cathy and Richard enjoy making guests feel comfortable, safe and we enjoy keeping our place in good shape.  We particularly welcome out-of-town guests and people from other countries.  We are happy to do what we can to help guests feel comfortable and are pleased to share ideas of places to visit, eat and enjoy in the city and surrounding area.

If you are looking for a long-term booking (more than three weeks) we are open to discussing special reduced rates.  We have hosted several long term guests (visiting professors, students, families who have come to Chicago to assist children with new grandchildren, etc.)  This is particularly true in the ""off season"" which in Chicago runs from late October through the middle of April.  We are pleased to see couples or individuals make our oasis in the city their home-away-from home, so please don't hesitate to discuss this possibility with us."

I am a fun and funny (yes, even though I am German....go figure!) person, who loves life and people.
 
My career in hotel business has provided hours of entertaining stories and experience... Growing up with two older sisters, I got stuck with their music - I love my Classic Rock and will see ""Rush"" anytime they play in my city. 

My German roots and my family over there are very important to me, as is my Catholic upbringing, but my love for THIS country rules, and I fulfilled a childhood dream by living here... 

I've lived in fabulous cities and made amazing friends along the way - I bet I have a story or two to share...

What else?! I've ran the Chicago Marathon in '11, motorcycled through Canada in '15, I like boxing and kayaking, bicycling and seriously hanging out on my couch with a good book or a great movie. 

I can also cook decently and love feeding and entertaining people, and I like heavy, dark wines and Macallan scotch. 
My husband and I like watching Netflix together and you are always welcome to join us.

A few years back, I founded a company called Peak Design that makes accessories for the photographic and outdoor industries.  We're based in San Francisco, but I split my time between there and Chicago so that I can spend half my month with my daughter Josephine.  Her mom and I live a few blocks apart in Chicago, and I live a few blocks from my work in San Francisco.

Airbnb has given me the opportunity to make this an affordable situation, and I'm grateful for it and the other marvels of the modern world that allow me to live in SF half the time and still have a full time relationship with my daughter.

In Chicago, I built the majority of the furniture.  In fact, the kitchen table, nightstands, writing desk, both beds, and the art project on the wall were all created in my basement workshop...all from wood that I found on the premises when I moved in!  This is part midwestern frugality (I grew up in Minneapolis), and part disdain for trips to the lumberyard.

In San Francisco, I live with friends and colleagues. All of us travel frequently, which is why too often our place is vacant, and that's a crying shame, because it is a truly beautiful home. We love the idea of sharing our home with the world through airbnb.

I try to take great care of my places, and I hope to find guests who appreciate their cleanliness and simplicity.

In the past five years alone I have set foot on every world continent - sometimes multiple times - and visited more than a dozen countries including Thailand, Japan, Argentina, Iceland, Italy, Peru, Australia, France, Morocco, Jamaica, England and Germany.  
All this travel means I really appreciate the facilities and touches the best hotels and Airbnb hosts have made to ensure my stay has been memorable and hassle free.
I have tried to learn from this and incorporated many of the best ideas at my own house so all my guests have a great experience and are able to live like a local in the  hip and happening Logan Square neighbourhood.
I want all my guests to return home raving about their comfortable, relaxing and unforgettable stay.

I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio and moved to Chicago 11 years ago. Aside from a few months spent in Nicaragua after college, a few months in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a month in Tokyo in 2015, I've stayed and absolutely loved living in Chicago. Other travels have included Prague, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Panama, Costa Rica, Japan, Uruguay, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and I'm gearing up for a very exciting few weeks photographing and filming in Kenya and Rwanda for a documentary series about extraordinary women doing great things around the world. 

I enjoy cooking but not as much as I like going out to dinner. I am equally as comfortable in a dive bar drinking cheap beer at the pool table as I am in a high end restaurant drinking fine wine and whiskey. Though, in an ideal world I would be sipping fine wine or whiskey at the dive bar pool table.

I see A LOT of live music, partially because I photograph a lot of musician portraits and live concerts for various publications, but ultimately just because I enjoy many types of music very much.

I want to provide an environment for artists & other creative, passionate individuals to have a voice & present their work. Sharing stories, ideas, experiences & realities are what we're in it for. We at the gallery are holding the torch in the neighborhood to provide a space for what might be unsayable elsewhere. We are daily developing our intentional space here to create an inspiring atmosphere for all who step foot inside, whether it's for a project proposal or a short visit. It's an older building, lovingly-worn, rooms with character surrounding an open gallery space.

I'm really crazy about FOOD and beverages (tea, coffee, beer, wine, bourbon, Japanese whiskey)...  I've been to most top restaurants in Chicago at least once, and I'm always on the scene sampling the latest...

I'm also nuts about traveling, so I usually get out of the country 4-5 times per year.  So far, I've been to nearly 60 countries and my favorites are pretty much all in Asia and Central/South America...  I love soccer, health and fitness, photography, skiing, surfing, hiking, biking, scuba diving...  DIY projects are fun and most nights you'll find me cooking up some food and enjoying some tea.

I never watch TV, ever.  I listen to all types of music, with a balanced concentration of hardcore hip-hop and contemporary piano.  I don't have a personal life motto, but I strongly believe that the world would be a better place if people were able to live in someone else's shoes for a day.  The more exposure to others and the more new experiences we encounter, the less ignorance, fear, and problems in the world.  Airbnb is great for that, and so I'm a big supporter..."

34837364,Molly,6/2/2015,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/34837364,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","I love to travel, and I love the idea of Airbnb. I had a wonderful first experience with Airbnb during my visit to Costa Rica, and I am excited to offer my own home as an Airbnb in Chicago. 

I am a single mom with a 14-year-old son, and am in the process of stepping into the gig economy as a free-lance writer, eBay tycoon, Airbnb super host, and farmer's market ""flower girl."" For the past year, I’ve been working as an Uber driver, and it is actually is one of the reasons I decided to become an Airbnb host. After picking up/dropping people off in downright unsafe or “middle of nowhere” neighborhoods, I realized that my place has a lot to offer. Even though it is a bit off the beaten path, it is close to a bunch of very cool neighborhoods, and it is easy to get downtown or to the lakefront. 

I have a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Vermont, and Chicago’s amazing architecture (and music scene) contributed to my decision to move here. I have actually lived in Chicago three separate times--the last time being the longest--when I moved back from Providence, Rhode Island, in 2003, leaving my job as the director of a history museum to be closer to my family before the birth of my son. 

I am a very easy-going roommate. Late-night noise, as long as it is reasonable, won't bother me, and I am not going to freak out if you don't do your dishes (although I will be very appreciative!). I am a smoker so if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, this space will not be a good fit. 

It is very likely that during your stay, I will either not be here at all (except during sleeping hours, loosely defined, of course!), or holed up in my bedroom/office working on various projects and job hunting. 

I like meeting new people and am generally up for a chat, but I am also cool with folks that want to keep to themselves and prefer more privacy. 

My son, depending on the rental date, may or may not be here (he stays at his dad's apartment part of the week).  If he is here, you probably won't see him much either--he likes to chill in his room or go out with his friends. Despite the fact that he's a teenager, I think he's a pretty good kid with good manners.

My other ""roommate"" is my 22 lbs. Labradoodle named Chestnut (or ""Chessie,"") a very sweet, cute dog who is shy around strangers. Fellow allergy sufferers please note that this breed is among those considered to be hypoallergenic, and I have had basically zero symptoms since getting her. (She doesn't shed at all.) If the dog being here is a big problem, I may be able to make arrangements for her to stay at my ex-husband's apartment, just let me know. "

We have been lucky enough to travel to crazy places like Bhutan and crawl through ancient Mayan caves in Belize, its been a lot of fun and will continue to be an integral part of all our lives. 

Through our travels we have met amazing people who welcomed us into their homes and made us feel connected to the local community! I first started using Airbnb obsessively when I was living in Denmark and using every free moment to travel around Europe. I loved the experience so much that I was able to convince my parents to ditch the traditional hotel route. We all have become huge Airbnb advocates, and wanted to open our home to people coming to Chicago!

Like most Chicagoans we are very proud of our city! There is so much to do and see and so many great restaurants to eat at, yes our local cuisine extends beyond deep dish pizza (but seriously deep dish is amazing)!

Laid back, down to earth professional.  Volunteerism is healthy for the soul.  

Home to me isn't about how fancy the furniture is, the knick-knacks one collects or how well decorated the place is. Home is a feeling.  A really, really good feeling once you're inside from the hustle and bustle of work and the everyday life.  The home I created is full of memories when I was a kid both growing up here in the States and the Philippine countryside; my dad's mid-century furniture, my aunt's $1 table find in the second hand store, the discarded dresser I found on the Detroit curb ,the books that makes me happy when they're opened, and to the art collection that spans 30 years.  They're all inside.

As an Airbnb guest, you are welcomed and greeted with open arms during your stay. There is no hustle or bustle here.  Those glitz and trends are all outside.  Please note that this it's not a hotel because nothing here is perfect.  The wood floors creek, left over paint still clinging onto the wood door trims.  The linens are clothes lined sun-bleached, the flowers and fruits are fresh from the farmer's market and iced tea is made the old fashioned way. I truly believe that authenticity is the best form of luxury.  Please feel right at home.

To me nothing rings truer than the old expression, ""home is where the heart is."" No matter where we've been during a hectic day of work or travel, and no matter what the day brings, coming home should be very special, and give you a sense of entering your sanctuary. Because home is so important to us all,  I take pride in knowing that the homes that we occupy are filled with love, warmth, and happiness.  Sharing our homes with friends and family brings us joy, and hopefully gives others joy in the process. My Motto: ""You today and me tomorrow"" sums up the feeling of making guests feel welcome and at home in our homes.
I travel the world for a living, and have an equal measure of love and respect for beautiful homes, architecture and design.  I tend to make myself at home where ever my travels lead me.
We share homes in gratitude to those who have generously and most graciously shared their homes with us along the road in our travels.  I am a true Chicago native, but have also made Brooklyn and all of New York City home.  In sharing our homes, we hope that you'll find your own love for the Amazing Cities that we call home as well.  Happy Travels!"

I worked for Apple. I currently consult with companies about technology/internet/social media/marketing/branding. We own the entire building and I work and live (some of the time) on the third floor with tenants on first floor. We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private), the second floor is a hostel style AirBnB, and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to three bedrooms that are available most days and every other weekend (when my kids are not staying with me).
I enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek. I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them — a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). 
If I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. 
I enjoy working out — lifting weights and riding a bike, plus I am a life-long swimmer. I also just started playing hockey! At age 52! Crazy. 
We have been hosting guests for three years now. We have over 141 reviews. We are a SuperHost. We love this. And we are really good at it.
I am a pretty laid back guy. I like things to be neat and tidy, but it's hard to do without motivation. AirBnB has been the motivation to get our place all tricked out and we are very proud of it. We hope you will enjoy staying here. All of our units are in a great neighborhood—in a great city. We have lots of suggestions for fun stuff to do, not the typical touristy stuff, but cool Chicago things that Chicagoans like to do/see. "

I also think people could benefit by saving money using this great tool, AirBnB, over the cost of hotels, parking and all the other ""little things"", that make people's trip to Chicago so expensive. I'm also the president of the condo association so stay with complete confidence knowing you're welcome here.

About me, a single Dad, work in a Engineering sales role that involves traveling overnight. I've also slowly started a real estate and packaging consulting business for my long term career goals to work for myself. For fun, I spend as much time as I can being a Dad and raising my daughter. When I take a break from that (every other weekend), I'll get out with some like minded friends for fun in the city or a weekend getaway trip.

 I spend as much time out on the porch as possible, doing writing and some stitching, tending flowers and a veggie garden out in the surrounding yards. I have my own little happy zone right here in the middle of a major metropolitan city, including friendly neighbors.
My little rat terrier Mayzee is my constant companion. 
Things I like to do...  Indie Films usually turn out to be my faves.  I go to some live theater, as well as help make it here in town. Books, got to have books always. And Bike Riding!.  I probably would love yoga if I would think to do it more Ha! 
Veggie food for me, sometimes I like to cook. Former foodie, did my time in the restaurant biz. 
If you would stay over here with me, you are welcome to make yourself at home.  Have your privacy or hang out, I leave it to you. My dog may like to have a cuddle, if you are up for that. You might want to hang by the electric fireplace heh, very mod, and toasty. I have lots of books to peruse for such an evening.
I know in traveling I look for the food of the people! I can tell you my spots or help you find what you might be looking for. Or bring take out, eat in the living room, or back porch if you like al fresco. 
But maybe you just want to  crash someplace tidy and less sterile than a hotel, that's cool. The building is old, maybe a hundred years? but it has all new plumbing and such, so I feel it is the best of both worlds. 
I don't know that I have a life motto, but I firmly believe in doing what makes me happy!
I look forward to meeting interesting people on their travels; feeds the brain!

As a guest of mine, you will definitely feel secure and safe in my home. I am pretty laid back and love to engage people.

A few facts about myself:
 - Love to cook
 - Very into fashion
 - I am a wine and whiskey gal, bourbon to be exact. I am more of a red wine drinker, but I recently just discovered a love for New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and can't get enough. It has been my summer wine along with Prosecco, which never lets me down.
 - Because I am a foodie, I love having dinner parties and cooking for my friends and family. I also love trying out new restaurants and bars.
 - I am the kind of person that will try almost anything once, so bring on the new and challenging experiences.
 - I love to binge watch shows and movies on most streaming devices. A few of my favorite shows are Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, etc... The list can go on and on. Also LOVE Korean dramas, especially the period pieces.
 - I am a lover of Art and History (I get the history part from my Dad)

I believe travel is the best form of education, there is nothing like immersing oneself in a new culture. You learn a lot about yourself and others when you do this and get to experience so many amazing things and people. The more I travel the more I learn that we are all the same on this planet and I realize that there is nothing I have gone thru that someone else hasn't. I always find myself in awe of the world that I live in and fall in love with it once again.

Anyway, I cannot wait to be your hostess or possibly your guest in the future. And I am excited to build new relationships that I hope will last a lifetime :)"

We very seldom stay in hotels. Due to the fact that we normally vacation for a least a week at a time, we tend to rent vacation homes/condos.

34141109,Jacquelyn,5/24/2015,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/34141109,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","I moved to Chicago in 2004 for college, and it has been my home ever since. Since then, I've experienced Chicago as a college student, a single person, a married person, and a mom.  I have completely fallen for this city in every phase of life. As much as I like the idea of traveling, I find that when we have vacation time, all I want to do is explore my city more.

Delicious food is plentiful, and I find the culture to be much more welcoming than most big cities. The city is big enough that there's always something new to experience, but the unique personality of the neighborhoods can still give it a small town feel.

The appeal of Airbnb for me is the thriftiness of it, but honestly, when I travel I appreciate more privacy. That's why I feel like our apartment was built to host guests because it provides you personal access to your room so you can feel like your on vacation and not meeting a new roommate for the first time. However, as I've said, I (and my whole family) love this city, so if you do have questions, just ask!

I am a well travelled guy who has been all over the world. I am a true budget traveller and that is why I set up this profile and my condo to answer to the needs of the traveller who share the same values as I do. I enjoy meeting and hosting travelers from all walks of life and every corner of the globe.

I always keep my place clean. After hosting and being hosted in different places by different people, I realized that not everybody has the same manners or understanding. Or not everybody was thought basic manners at home when they were young. 

The whole purpose of setting this profile was *to help* people and give back a little to return the good karma that was given to me by others. I know I am helping to people and *giving them a deal*, so remember that if you appreciate my hospitality you can always come back. My intent is to create a pool of regular guests and future friendships based on this.

I am a very caring and considerate host; also I am a very busy person and my life does not shape around Airbnb and I do this as a hobby. If I decline your request without providing a reason, it means I am either travelling for work or using the place for other purposes. Do not seek other meanings behind that.

Good luck."

21145959,James,9/9/2014,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/21145959,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","Hello,

I'm James! I currently live in Chicago, IL U.S.A. I love traveling and prefer not to stay in hotels, because I enjoy being immersed in the culture of the place I visit. I've come to appreciate the convenience and accommodations AirBnB provides and am grateful to my hosts & guests. :)

Bio:
I am a medical student in Chicago and former graduate of the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience, minor in Musicology. I received my Masters of Science in Health Sciences. I formerly worked as an Associate Healthcare IT Strategy Consultant for Strategy&, formerly Booz & Company (post merger with PwC). My previous research on Alzhiemer's Disease at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine was published in the Journal of Neuropathology & Experimental Neurology.

How I host:
I host how I want to be hosted. Traveling for leisure and work, I enjoy staying in the best hotels or homes. I have made my accommodations reflect the places I've traveled and the small (& large) luxuries I've seen. I offer a comfortable welcome in my home with large, sunlit rooms, high ceilings, king-bed, clawfoot private bath tub/shower, coffee/snacks, TV with Netflix & surround sound, and personal recommendations on attractions & restaurants. Being a foodie & coffee-fiend helps! I will respect and accommodate your stay as we share a mutual respect for my home. I hope you enjoy your stay in my humble abode. 

How I travel:
Because I used to travel weekly across country for work, I travel light. I stay clean, quiet, and neat because I respect myself and my hosts. I keep friends with the same mentality. I have excellent hygiene. When I travel, I only use where I stay as a place to sleep or rest. I prefer to spend my days exploring the area and evenings visiting nice restaurants or musical performances. I try to absorb the communities I visit and learn and embrace the culture. I'm very open to learning, talking and always prefer to be honest with my communication. I'm also very humble and caring for my friends and family. I look forward to staying in your beautiful home.

I spend a large portion of the year traveling for music and film projects.  My partner is a PhD student at UChicago.  

We are both absolutely in love with Chicago.  When we are home, we spend a lot of our time at Lake Michigan (we know the best swimming spots, away from the beaches), eating tacos in our neighborhood, riding bikes and exploring all over the city, and hanging out with our baby, the sweetest Pomeranian named Lamb (who also joins in on most of our adventures).

We both love to travel.  Some of our favorite adventures have been camping all over New Zealand, staying in a treehouse in the Phi Phi Islands in Thailand, hot air ballooning in North Georgia, scooting and lounging around Culebra, Puerto Rico, and snowboarding in Zermatt, Switzerland... to name a few.  

We both enjoy interior design, backyards, photography, minimalism, coffee, being outside, swimming, building fires, and biking.

Miguel is a gregarious 4th grader who shares a love of language with his English major parents. Watch out for puns and silly jokes. He is also learning to play piano, and is working his way through Harry Potter scores and West Side Story. One of his current interests is the Titanic. He has become quite the expert!

Five things that I can't live without would be my faith, family, my cell phone (no seriously), fresh air spaces and positive friends.

I have an eclectic taste for music and usually gravitate to indie artists; I am not too much into mainstream music.  My favorite food is Mexican food and Chicago-style pizza of course.  

As an Airbnb host, I would like to share my entire condo with you.  As a host, I can be a resource if needed, but I also realize that the best way to explore a city is to simply allow my guest(s) to explore the city on their own and discover all of the unique wonders that a great location has to offer.

And a little more about me in case you're interested:

Some of my favorite movies are (old skool) Sound of Music, Imitation of Life, Best Man, (more contemporary) Forrest Gump, The Incredibles, Iron Man, Coach Carter, City of God. As far as music, love neo-soul, R&B, old skool hip-hop, some pop is cool, and salsa and other latin music. Think Anthony Hamilton, Janelle Monae, and Diego Torres. I love traveling, as a tourist, but even more when I get to meet local people and really get a feel for everyday life and culture. I like learning other languages; there's nothing like being able to communicate with people in their native tongue!

  I received my MS in Healthcare Administration in 2000 & am currently working full time at a hospital downtown.  I found out how interesting the study of law could be in 2009, but an MBA seemed more marketable, so I started working on that Fall 2012.  Never stop learning......
from my kids, as well as in the classroom!
   I love meeting new people, for the same reason, so what better way than to step out of my comfort zone & follow in my daughter's footsteps here at AirBnB.

86713417,Scout,7/29/2016,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/86713417,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","Hi, I'm Scout! I would say if I were a type, it's of the earty-witchy-hippie variety, but I can cross borders from Kanye to Dave van Ronk, hippie to goth, extrovert to introvert, in a matter of minutes or seasons or years. I'm agreeable, and kind, but I can also cut right to the heart of a matter when it's called for. I can nearly always tell you what phase the moon is in, and if something ails you, I probably have a salve or tincture or tea for that.

I am a pretty quiet person, I mostly just cook in the main space, listen to music, and play my guitar on the fire escape, and I like a good chat over coffee.

As recommended by AirBnb, here are a few things about me...

five things I can't live without:
local, seasonal food
coffee
my records, and Spotify
avocados
my dog and cat

I have enjoyed a few trips, most recently to Lima, Pucallpa, and Iquitos, Peru, as well as Savannah GA, Port-au-Prince Haiti, Lake Ontario (both sides of the border), and a yearly trip to Eau Claire Wisconsin (ask me about Eaux Claires festival, I can't say enough about how great it is). I cant wait to travel more, and I'd love one day to see Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and Sicily (where my family came from many decades ago). I love camping, and I'm dead into ""roughing it"". I like the idea of experiencing a place as it really is when I travel, and I hope I can provide that same kind of experience for my guests.

I grew up in rural Virginia, and I've definitely brought a lot of that upbringing with me to the city -- I keep a fire escape garden, and I have a beehive on the rooftop. I either play, or am learning to play, a variety of instruments -- I have two synthesizers, four guitars, a mandolin, a banjo, a variety of percussion inventions, a drum machine/sampler, and a didgeridoo.

I spend most of my time doing house chores, learning about and practicing herbalism, reading (fiction, poetry, and educational books), playing and listening to music, especially vinyl records, sometimes going to live shows, and the highlight of my week is the Sunday farmers market."

Born and raised in Chicago, I became an avid traveller and barter enthusiast. I've been travelling for 20 years and could easily write my own book on travelling on a budget.  I PRIDE myself on the deals I would obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. I can go on.  I'm geeked when I find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, my website for my guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

I feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why I simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.   

Since I don't travel as much as I used to....Let your experience be my experience!

I look forward to meeting you.  "

Sometimes you won't see me hardly at all, sometimes I'll be around quite a bit, depends our schedules. But the space is designed as such that each of us has plenty of privacy when desired.

As a guest: When I stay at Airbnb I don't spend much time at the rental! I tend to be out and about, and primarily use it for sleeping and cleaning up."

I have not been to one place I have not loved, and any stressful situation has later turned into a fantastic story!  Before the social media connections on the world wide web, I accidentally booked a hostel in the red-light district in England- it is now a great story! :) There is also the time I traveled all by myself in France, and accidentally fell asleep, missing my stop. That said, I have been to Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain and Switzerland, as well as all over the U.S! There are still so many places left to explore, and what works for me is having points of interest with no set agenda, as long as I can experience that place as a local.

Currently, I am a teacher and back in graduate school which is helping me truly learn the meaning of leading a balanced life! Before that, I was a die-hard runner trying to run long-distance races across as many states as I could. I do plan on running my 14th state after I am done with graduate school! If you are a runner looking for a great Chicago race, I can point you to many I have enjoyed dearly!

My life motto is: Love everyone, Courage in difficult times and Trust the unknown. Life gives you what you put out there, so I am trying to lead a life as a servant leader. As an Airbnb host, I hope I can provide you with a great experience by sharing my home and city. My neighborhood is what Andersonville and Lincoln Square were before they became ""discovered.""

I've got a great corporate 9-5 where I basically get to play with mobile apps all day for a fortune 50 company, which affords me the luxury of focusing on the things that truly make me happy when I'm not in the office.  In my spare time, I'm Board President at a local Chicago based non-profit where we help kids in underserved communities build literacy skills through creative writing (Barrel of Monkeys) and I'm also a founding company member of a pretty cool little theater company that creates adaptations of big budget blockbusters and then brings them to the small stages of Chicago (InGen Productions).

I'm also an avid cook, vegan, craft beer and vino lover, cat owner, and can't get enough live music, comedy and outdoor time when its warm. My happy place is in the kitchen on lazy days, and in the dance studio mastering new moves on those days that are a little less lazy.

I'm hoping to do more travel, especially internationally, over the next few years. I've been using Airbnb for a while as a guest, but have recently decided to try my hand at hosting to rent out some of my domestic spots I've already stayed at a number of times. Although they are all GREAT spots, I want to expand my horizons and see some new places. I am hoping that this will help! 

Any other questions, please ask!  Thanks for reading about me, and I look forward to learning more about you soon!

I was born in Chicago and grew up in Wrigleyville on the Northside of Chicago which is a vibrant and diversified neighborhood.  I have a wonderful husband and an incredible daughter and have lived in our home for almost three decades.
For 15 years, I was honored to teach students Interior Design and Architecture at a Design College in Chicago.  I love to travel to other countries and experience their culture, language and foods.  My favorite cities so far, Amsterdam, Paris, Mexico City and Antwerp.  I hope to continue travels to far-off distant lands.  I used Airbnb for my second trip to Paris, and really preferred it to staying in a hotel.  And the primary reason for hosting on Airbnb is to offer guests the ability to experience Chicago and its unique neighborhoods in a home setting.  I enjoy meeting people from different states, countries and from diverse cultures.
My favorite foods are enjoyed in the company of my family and dear friends: Roasted Chicken, Margherita style thin-crust Pizza, Grilled vegetables, a nicely poached or grilled Fish, Thai, Vietnamese and Italian food.
My favorite books: “To Kill a Mockingbird”, “Music for Chameleons” and the “Harry Potter” series.  My favorite music: Bach’s “Concerto for Two Violins in D minor”, Debussy’s “Claire de Lune”, Puccini’s “Nessun Dorma”, Kern & Field’s “The Way You Look Tonight”, Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall”, “Hey You” and “Money”, Beatles’ “Hey Jude”, Marc Anthony’s “El Cantante”, Adele’s “21” album and Sam Smith’s “In the Lonely Hour”.

Having traveled extensively with the US Army seeing over 33 countries, those experiences and encounters (don't ask they’re  classified!) have shaped the renaissance man I am today - writer, rugger, reader, weight lifter, and much more. As a couple, we are big foodies - always searching for new culinary adventures, we're into rugby (former player), hockey, and baseball, and have a huge affinity for all games board and card. A typical night out for us may include karaoke at Bobby Love's, playing Trivial Pursuit, or working up a sweat at Holiday Club.

I've lived in Chicago for 10+ years, originally from outside of Detroit.  Bought the place where I host an apartment two years ago, in the Logan Square neighborhood, and have been enjoying living in the building/experiencing home ownership 101.

I enjoy photography, a hobby I recently picked up--so much to learn! Plenty of good places within a short walk of my place to explore and take photos... I found a mom and 5 baby raccoons in Humboldt Park recently! 

I enjoy traveling with my boyfriend, Dave.  So far we've stayed pretty close to Chicago--Wisconsin/Michigan or traveling for the holidays.--Colorado, Florida.  Looking forward to checking out Iceland at some point with him, photography opportunities are apparently amazing.

When I travel/am thinking about my hosted apartment, I like to find places with character that are comfortable.  I can't resist a cozy space that makes me feel like I'm escaping my day to day.  

Hope our paths cross one day! "

My most recent trip was in September 2016 when I visited the Swiss Alps and went to Oktoberfest!  It was a great trip.  Someday I also hope to travel to Australia & New Zealand, as well as go on an African safari!  

I also try to go skiing in the Rocky Mountains at least once each year (Big Sky, Montana is my favorite hill) and I love watching college football.

79576295,Erin,6/23/2016,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/79576295,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","       I'm a travel-loving mom whose son is away at college. I have time to travel now, and offer my adorable, convenient, quaint space! 
       My 4th fl. apt is tiny & cozy. The building is 100 yrs old and has most of its original design (including the accordion-gate elevators, which are rather comedic, but I appreciate their authenticity). The bathtub is original, and longer and deeper than those of today. 
     The view is to the south, so the nighttime shows off the Hancock Bldg and the Sears Tower (I can't bring myself to call it by its new name: the Willis Tower) and early mornings with my coffee, staring at the glowing skyline are my favorite.
There is a little office area with a desk off of the kitchen.
       There is room for two - one twin bed, and a couch that doubles as a daybed. PLEASE NOTE: There are only two one-person beds. Each bed fits only ONE person each. Prior guests have reviewed that the bed is “a bit small for two.”....and that's because it's not MEANT for two! :):):)
       My style is earthy, bohemian, and nature-inspired. Many of my belongings and furniture were acquired from my travels and from flea markets. There is a faux fireplace where I place candles, giving the space an extra-coziness, especially at night. 
       The apartment is just a few blocks from the red line (subway), three stops from Wrigley Field, one block from the bus stop. I no longer own a car, and I don't miss it with how convenient public transportation is in Chicago! Should you drive here, much of the parking around the bldg is free, some requires a permit. Make sure to read the signs along each street before choosing a spot. It's easier to find a spot during the day than the night, but I always found a spot, regardless. 
       There is free wi-fi and cable, including HBO.
       The neighborhood has three historic music venues: The Riviera, The Aragon Ballroom, and the Green Mill Lounge - famous for being Al Capone's go-to back in the day (cash bar only). There's a Starbucks and other coffee shops within walking distance, and many different types of restaurants including Ethiopian, Mexican, Vietnamese and other Asian choices. 
I especially love the short 3/4 mile walk to Lake Michigan. There is so much to love here.
***IMPORTANT: Note my strict cancellation policy.
Also, check-out time in 12pm. Cleaning is done at 1pm.  IF you need to stay past noon, will be a $20 fee, payable via app / web transfer or cash, about which you and I will communicate should you need the extra time. Thank you for understanding!

112016025,Randall,1/17/2017,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/112016025,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","In 2015, I hit the reset button on my life; or maybe it was life's hand on the button.   I was in the 26th year of a high paying but dissatisfying job that I was afraid to leave.  I was in the 25th year of a mutually unhappy relationship to which I felt some moral obligation to stay.  I had few friends. little energy and few interests outside of work.  In retrospect, I was depressed.  First, she found someone new.  Then, I was let go due to budget cuts.  Although that year was filled with uncertainty, all of the sudden I felt so much lighter.  My previously miserable existence was not brimming with opportunities (the opportunities had been there, I had just grown to not recognize them).  My mantra became a sort of ""why not"".  I gave up my car, most of my possessions. and moved to the home of a friend in Chicago.  I had a hobby rock and mineral shop located in The Chicago Mosaic School.  I started spending long hours there every day.  I started becoming helpful... cleaning up, organizing, locating materials, running errands.  Soon the school hired me on as their Operations Officer.  I started becoming sociable too...accepting and extending invitations to dinner, concerts, movies, evenings spent just hanging out.  Soon I had more friends than I'd known in the last 25 years.  Good friends.  The kind who will speak to your face the same way they speak of you when you are not present.  Now, thanks to one of those friends, I am in this fantastic apartment, close to The Chicago Mosaic School.  I'm back to doing the things I enjoy... listening to alternative music, rock and fossil collecting, camping, bird watching, gardening, and spending quality time with those friends.  Many of my guests are friends and artists who come to Chicago throughout the year in order to take classes at The Chicago Mosaic School.  I enjoy hosting them and spending entertaining evenings together. In a world made up of so much conflict and competition, I personally find it very encouraging to see people of different ages, genders, education, vocation and experience come together cooperatively under one roof and connect with one another for an evening or a few days.  I hope everyone who elects to stay here departs with a smile."

Igor is a Mr. Fix It who loves road trips and can beat anyone at a round of US History trivia. Together we speak five languages (English, French, Russian, Spanish, and German) and have traveled quite a bit! 
We love hosting people from around the country or the world and hearing their stories of what brings them to our little neighborhood.

We both work a lot and spend a lot of time outside the house, but when I'm home, I love to cook dinner, snacks, or cookies for guests. 

If you’re more into exploring the neighborhood, Igor has lived in the area for almost 7 years so he gives the best recommendations on where to get the perfect cold craft beer, or richest cup of coffee, or the tastiest late morning brunch.

Having had season MLB ticket in Chicago, yes, I've attended hundreds of MLB games in Chicago (including the first regulation Cub night game in 1988 and the 2007 Buehrle no hitter).  At age 20 I celebrated New Year's eve feasting on a sheep's head in Istanbul; I've also been to Beijing nine times to marvel at the Spring Festival fireworks;  I rode a white mule to the base of Grand Canyon, walked along the Continental Divide in Glacier Park, and shopped the casbah in Marrakesh.

I have been to most of the European countries. Ireland is my favorite and have a thatched cottage in County Kerry that has been a labor of love. Animals are a big passion of mine and I have 3. I support Young at Heart which is a No Kill senior animal rescue. My family is a big part of my life. I am a single parent and my son was adopted from Russia when he was 4 years and 10 months. Blessed to come from a very loving family. I have 3 sisters and 1 brother. My beautiful mother Mary who is 86 works 5 days a week for our 58 year old family business. So does my brother Paul whos is the youngest. 
I was a member of the Guardsmen Drum and Bugle Corps from Schaumburg Il. I marched for 10 years and directed and taught this group for 17 years when the group had to dispand due to financial hardships. My younger brother and sister also marched in the group. My parents and sisters were involved in some way or another. In 2012 the Harty Family was inducted in to the Heartland Drum Corps Association Hall of Fame. The Guardsmen made the DCI World Championship Finals 4 times. The indoor winter colorguard made the WGI World finals 10 times and won a Bronze medal in 1981. I was one of the founders of the WGI organization. Needless to say I am blessed to have friends all over the country.

I try my best to find, create, and decorate 5 star accommodation's that are 5 star experiences from the ground up, while maintaining the comfort of feeling the at ""home"" Vibe! I began my journey of travel at the tender age of 15, when my mother allowed me to travel to Quito Ecuador for a little over a month!
I have traveled, South America, Europe,  the Middle East and all over the USA and Canada! 
My journey with airbnb began a little over 2 years ago, and I have had the pleasure of hosting 3000+ global guests in this short period of time. I love staying at nice, clean places as I'm sure you will too! I have had a 90% positive guest response rate with most being 5 star guests, so I love to create an ultimate experience for all of my past, present, and future guests!
When you stay in any of my places I make myself readily available 24/7 no answering services or dashboards, I am the real deal.... Just me! Airbnb is an amazing opportunity to network and connect with the entire world and due to this wonderful platform I no longer book hotels (I prefer a CLEAN kitchen to cook in).
My passion for music trumps all other arts, from Bach, Mary, and Outkast... I love all types of artistry! I am always on the go but here when you need me day and night!
Chicago is my favorite city for food, it even beats NYC (and I am usually partial) lol being born and raised in NYC for the majority of my life! The carribean is by far my favorite travel destination, as I adore the sands and salt water!
My motto is ""If at 1st you don't succeed, Dust yourself off and try again""!

I've travelled to New Orleans and Mexico the most in my adult life, but excited to head to Cuba and Costa Rica for the first time next year.

She's still kickin at 96!  I make playlists as often as I can based on anything that grabs me, thats a lot of different genres.  I am an avid reader (I prefer horror and fantasy and it's mostly through the Audible App), a prolific cook (I can cook/prepare 8+ meals a day with a strong variety and it's usually just at night), and I love to craft, my current favorite being cross stitch, where I stitch bitchy sayings and Morrissey lyrics, still learning how to stitch things other than words and borders.

Visitors to Chicago should not miss: The amazing park system (our motto is Urbs in Horto - City in a Garden) including the lakefront (City By The Lake anyone?) and its lakefront trail. Our museums are world class, especially the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC), Museum of Contemporary Photography (MoCP) and Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) The music scene - specifically the amazing blues talent we have (look for my buddy and Delmark recording artist Toronzo Cannon when he's playing locally). Food! Coffee! Did we mention food? And have you tried the coffee? And, of course, the amazing architecture (I'm a big fan of Jeanne Gang's work).

I've done a fair amount of travel and have recently landed in my friend's one hundred year old building in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the Northside of Chicago. I couldn't be happier about living in this location! Between being steps away from the beach, the friendly culturally diverse neighborhood, and the up and coming restaurants and cafes, I'm enjoying my lovely spacious nest. 

I've always liked addressing spaces in ways that speak to the function of each room making the environment fun to be in. In years past I've been a stylist and had a beautiful shop where I sold everything from vintage clothing, antique costumes from the Lyric Opera, kimonos and couture to art and vintage lifestyle items. I continue to style people mainly from my collection.

I spent four years running Open Secret Studios with the purpose of supporting art, culture and humanitarian causes. I rented out the space for photography, video and private events to support the things I care about. I became adept at providing a beautiful backdrop and keeping clients happy before, during, and after event experiences. I hope to do the same for you here. 

I am offering my home to travelers and am happy to give you space and share information about events going on around town. I have lived all over the city from Downtown to the Westside to Fulton Market and have found Rogers Park appealing on many levels without the pretension. I love living so close to the lake and look forward to discovering historic architecture on my walks through the neighborhood.

I practice yoga and meditation as well as swim, hike, bike, and make art in my  studio in the house. I make collage and mosaic from old ceramic pieces and plates found on beaches all over the world. I also work in textiles. 

In the future, I would love to find myself part of a group creating an upscale communal environment with a garden, private and public spaces, studios, and  indoor and outdoor spaces to host speakers, film makers, musicians and chefs to engage the community.

You know that question you're always asked when trying to find your purpose in life.  When your counselor asks, ""If you had all the money in the world, what would you do?""  The answer.  I would travel.
Grant it, one unfortunately does need money for the most part to travel. So I've picked up a few other meaningful projects in my life, called jobs.  :)

I brought all three of my little babies home to this location from the hospital, but before they were born I thorougly enjoyed it as a bachelorette pad.  With kids, I got to see a whole new kid friendly side to the neighborhood walking every where to all the tourist spots, like the Lake, Museums, Parks, and exploring all the cooler neighborhoods surrounding the home.  We use vacation as a source to rest, relax, and reconnect with my family and a way to unplug from work.

We love local day trips (easier to not pack for 5 people lol), sometimes will do longer trips. We love NYC for that and visiting family near Atlanta and Miami. We love visiting old homes and estates near and far. 
I love historical books about great leaders, currently reading the Magnificient Medill’s, Chicago’s dynasty that started the Republican Party and got Abraham Lincoln into office via the Chicago Tribune and the family later added Wgn news and television& New York newspapers and national magazines. We strongly recommend that you take a trip out to his estate in the suburbs called Cantigny, it is our favorite place to relax and recharge!  Our favorite movies are children movies because of the kids lol and we love Scarface and Godfather trilogies, rap and Spanish music, and Italian food (check my guide for authentic spots, the rest are Olive Gardens in disguise).

As a host, we want to be able to fix any short comings you have, please be upfront with us and share and we can explain or help the situation. We are disappointed that the City of Chicago has forbidden us from leaving you food and beverage niceties, because we would love nothing more than to help your stay be the best!

As a guest, we are super respectful of rules and homes we stay in. We spotlessly (well my husband) clean and make sure the kids are well behaved and watched. We do not complain. We are not needy. We will not leave bad reviews because we understand that you are opening up your home to our family and we want to treat you and your home and your livelihood on Airbnb with the utmost respect. 

Our family believes in hard work, acting and dressing like ladies and gentlemen, being open to new ideas and strategies, big picture, setting high goals, hiring to achieve those goals, perseverance, Church, family time, fashion, dressing well (not comfortably), never giving up, being kind, helping others, being unabashedly dedicated to the cause of educating and helping young families with expenses associated with child rearing and bearing."

Life Motto: ""Life is not fair. Sometimes dreams do not come true. Sometimes you're not the hero in the story of your life. And sometimes, people die before they're supposed to. Life is not fair. But fair has nothin' to do with who you are inside, what you dream about, who you love, and what you stand for. Life cannot touch that..."" - Roger Aaron Brown | The LXD"

We are non-smokers, quiet, and usually in our room unless you express interest in having a buddy to hang out with. My partner and I love to meet our guests and at least introduce ourselves but sometimes aren't afforded with that opportunity due to our busy schedules.   We have a small Shih Tzu named Oscar who is absolutely adorable!  They are hypoallergenic dogs that do not shed like other dogs so there's no concern for animal dander and hair. Oscar loves people but will mostly stay in our room with us.  He's very lazy and quiet!  All my furniture is brand new!!  My apartment is a clean quiet space for anyone to relax.  There is abundant street parking in my neighborhood that is free, which is a huge convenience for people with vehicles!  Public transportation is also conveniently located and is walking distance from the apartment!   If you need any information about the city we’re your guide!  Feel free to contact me for further information and I look forward to meeting you!  Ciao"

I recently acquired a job with a digital marketing agency where I spend my time making websites, brand strategies, and creating content such as photos and blog articles for clients!  Let me know if you have an interest in any of the above!

I graduated from Northwestern University in 2013 and never left the city of Chicago because I had a desire to explore and learn and build my creative career here. Chicago is an absolutely wonderful place to live and grow.

I put together MaiTri Chicago in early 2017 because I wanted a space where people can teach others and learn and connect from other people who are like minded, mindful, and creative people. MaiTri is a community full of artists and healers. We co-create workshops, yoga classes, and politically mindful artist showcases to the mindful community. 

The desire to connect and give others a way to connect never went away since my study abroad experiences in London and Prague and my work experience with the creative artists here in Chicago. I enjoy it more than ever and I frequently travel overseas to major world cities to open my mind and have new experiences .... ~ I love what we do .

I love meeting new people and being a helper, hosting is win-win.  I get some needed cash, and you save some.
Who knows, what you will learn and if you will meet a new friend or not.

I believe that everyone should be, and deserves as the very least to be acknowledged if at all possible.  When you say ""Hello"" to a person walking by, they usually light up.  Maybe that's the only time someone said Hi or looked them in the eye?"

We saw an opportunity above the bar we own/operate to expand our experiences in hospitality and design. So we jumped into the Air Bnb game! Got started with ""The Secret Stache"". A month later we started booking up ""Hotel California"". We love rock n roll, family-style dining and hosting parties. We are quick and super responsive if our presence is needed at the Hotel or The Stache. Otherwise, as far as we're concerned it's your home for the entirety of your stay and we respect it as such.

2) Sheffield's is a good casual spot to grab a bite on the way to / from a Cubs game, if you're looking to escape the biggest crowds.... 
3) In the cooler months, the nearby 404 Wine Bar is a cozy place to linger around a fireplace...
4)  If you're looking to save some $$, there are several good BYOB restaurants with no corkage fee in the neighborhood (Home Bistro, Tango Sur...)
5) If you've never been to Chicago before, head over to the lakefront path for a walk or a run, and try not to miss the architectural tour on the river.  It may sound touristy, but don't let that put you off - it is definitely worth doing.

We met while working abroad & recently relocated to Chicago to be closer to family & enjoy this fantastic city.

In 2016 we bought this 130+ year old historic greystone home.  We spent 18 months meticulously taking it apart one wooden beam at a time. After overhauling the heating, plumbing, & electric with the most efficient systems we could find, we then put it all back together - preserving as much of the original hardwood, bricks & beautiful finishes we possibly could. We found there is indeed truth to the phrase 'labor of love', and we couldn't be more proud of the work we've accomplished.  

Our professional careers revolve around sustainability & we try to lead our lives as close to our environmentally friendly values as we can while still leading modern, robust lives. We love spending as much outdoors time as the weather allows us;  hiking, gardening, skiing - we love it all.  When indoors, we make use of an extensive tool collection (we have an entire storage area dedicated to it), & tinker on home improvements .. most often while sipping either a craft beer or glass of dynamic wine."

My name is Helen Trueblood, I have been a Platinum time share owner through Club Wyndham and  have been for many years.  Recently, I was able to upgrade to Presidential Reserve and become Platinum Presidential Reserve. This being the highest status you can go opens up a much wider range of benefits through Wyndham and allows me access to more resorts than non Presidential Reserve owners . 

     Our goal with  Airbnb is to allow other families or people/person to travel to these locations for just a vacation, public event or private event. We will have many locations posted, however, if you'd go to Club Wyndham through your browser and find a resort you wish to stay at just message me on here or my  other contact: Instagram- holidays_by_helen

Our love of travel, food, art and counter-culture is what brought us together. As a couple we love traveling and spontaneity is what we live for. Our first trip together was a last minute getaway to Morocco and we've been together ever since. Raquel is from Chicago but lived in Glasgow, Scotland for 8 years it's a huge part of her life with yearly trips to Scotland always firmly in the calendar. When it comes to hosting we find we get along best with seasoned travelers who are down to earth and spontaneous. We tend not to be able to accept bookings far in advance because we don't know when we might want to head out of town ourselves. We also find it works out better if guests have some idea of where they'd like to go, it'll help us point them in the right direction. With that said, local thrift stores, hidden breakfast spots, local boutiques and dive bars are our specialty; so we will have lots of recommendations. We don't spend a lot of time downtown, so if that's where you'll be hanging out we're NOT the hosts for you. If you'd like to see what downtown has to offer we suggest staying, well, downtown.  When we're not exploring our own city we're on a plane headed to a land far, far way. "

We love our location near Hyde Park, the University of Chicago, the Lake and the Parks and just over 10 minutes to downtown Chicago via the Lake.  

Our family of four takes full advantage of the walking and bike trails in the area. We also frequent nearby Hyde Park, for its distinctive and unique offerings and to hopefully, run into a friend or two.

We still love to road trip but our favorite trips are with our extended family.  Last year 20+ family members descended upon San Pedro, Belize.  This year less exotic Washington, DC is on the list.

Because I have Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis I am an licensed Illinois Medical Cannabis patient.  I live a healthy lifestyle which includes being gluten free.  You probably won't find any gluten in my place.  I encourage and teach others how to incorporate health into their lives.

We all love to read and take books with us on vacation.  Sometimes we wing it, just start driving and book from the road with a last minute hotel app.  Sometimes we plan a year in advance.

I've only had two guests but I love hosting!  I am so into creating a great experience for people, I am looking forward to each and every guest.  I'm very friendly and talkative, however, I intend to disappear so guests can create their own memories.

One of my many mottos:  Eat dessert first.

I'm Carolyn, and I would like to meet you.
I have a big, cool quirky house where I live on the first floor, which is way too quiet when guests are not here. Come and stay in the full apartment upstairs-it's like Alice in Wonderland but with lots of chandeliers. I think having a sense of humor is so important-laughing is good for the soul. I enjoy being surrounded
by beauty like sparkling crystal lights and bright happy colors, and take great care in providing a safe, love-filled place to stay. There will always be peace here inside and out - no street noise or traffic. Positive and encouraging your experience will be.
I am the always-available host who will give you the tour of your apartment when you arrive, showing you how to work the Keurig coffee maker and how to find Netflix on the flat screen TV, and just generally help you enjoy wonderful Chicagoland.  I have been remodeling for 6 months, everything is new and fresh and waiting.
I have been in the service industry for 30 years (restaurants), and my style is to do unto others as I would like done for me.  I am a thoughtful and good person and I open my home to meet others who want a new friend (or just a place to sleep).
Call me-I'll help you figure it out : )

When I'm not traveling or hosting, I love to create. Its an amazing experience to plant a seed, watch it sprout then nurture it pesticide free. The result is infusing each botanical and creating a skin healthy product!

I'm originally a Miami girl and I moved out here to attend Shimer college. Weird little Great Books school. So, if you ever feel the itch to discuss Kant while on vacation, I'm your dude. Besides that stuffy sounding bit of info about myself, I like going out to different bars in the city (I know a lot of good ones, ask!). I love a bar with character, a neighborhood hole in the wall with shots and beers and history. There's also a lot of really great fancy pants cocktail joints in the city I can point you to. Chicago has a pretty crazy food and drink scene right now so you should definitely experience that in some capacity while you're in the city. The music scene is also ""tippy top."" I love going out dancing in this city, it's a real music nerd's paradise. Smart Bar and Danny's are always bumpin'. And there's always free shows at Empty Bottle on Monday nights that are worth checking out. In short, I enjoy food, drinking, dancing, and intensive introspection above all things - I'm a real hoot."

Some of my favorite places are Taiwan, Nicaragua, France, Thailand, Singapore, Jourdan, Italy, Spain, and right here in Chicago. I just moved from New York, after having lived there for 10 years, so being back in Chicago is wonderful!  I love new experiences and exchanges and good, positive energy.

I'm very friendly, calm, artsy, and outgoing. I dance, make dances, make art, and teach. When I'm not doing that I'm cooking, reading, being in nature, out with friends, being poetic, living life!

My home is me. After traveling so much, I love to come home to something that centers me. My place is quiet, open, cozy, comforting, bright, and relaxing--the perfect place to recharge.

We both enjoy gardening, having game nights with our friends, exploring the city (especially in the summer), and traveling. Independently, I enjoy playing soccer with my rec team, practicing Spanish, and reading about news and politics. Molly enjoys interior design, volunteering at a local no-kill shelter, and discovering new Celiac-friendly recipes or restaurants.

We love this city, our neighborhood, and our home! We hope you'll come experience the comfort of our AirBnB, the beauty of Logan Square, and excitement of the city of Chicago. "

Now that my wife and I have a place of our own, we are trying out the hosting side of Airbnb.  

I've lived in Chicago since 2014 and I love the city.  The public transportation is one of the best in the country.  There are tons of museums and festivals to explore.  We have miles of lakefront parks and a great bike path that connects them all.  When it's warm, the beaches in Chicago are just as nice as either ocean coast, and it's all fresh water.

We are spoiled here with the food scene as well.  There's everything from Michelin star restaurants to those little hole in the wall places that actually have really good food.  Chicago has neighborhood pubs as well as fancy rooftop clubs downtown.  It just really depends what you are into.  

It's frigid cold for more months out of the year than I would prefer, but the summer/fall is wonderful.  I always joke that if the city of Chicago happened to be a little farther south like Atlanta, no one would want to live anywhere else.  And despite what the media says, Chicago is actually a very safe place.  I've never felt uneasy or threatened walking around at night.  The dangerous pockets that always make headline news tend to be centralized in very specific south/west neighborhoods.  And when visiting the city, there is no reason to go anywhere near those neighborhoods.  

When we are in the city, I like doing the usual things on the weekend.  Going out to brunch on Saturday or Sunday.  Bike riding.  Hanging out at the beach, or on my friend's rooftop patio.  I'm a bit of a board game nerd too so when the weather is rough, my wife and I like hosting friends and family over for dinner and games.  I have an appreciation for weird crafty beers, so there's usually something interesting in my fridge.  We like to grill in the back patio.  

Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.

I lived in Granada, Spain for five months a few years ago (I will have to get a hang of the differences in Spanish and have been reading about it!) I fell in love with traveling and am so excited to learn about the culture of Buenos Aires and those who live here. I enjoy meeting new people and am a very open minded, passionate person. I believe that seeing the world can open one's eyes, and I am grateful to have this experience to do so. I cannot wait to soak in the city of Buenos Aires and see many other cities in South America. My plans regarding housing are tentative, so this is a great resource I would love to use!"""

The six things I can not live without is a great book,  lip gloss, mascara, cell phone and Netflix. And I would love to live in Los Angeles, not only do I really like the area, I think the weather in South Cal is the best. 

My life moto is that I've never met anyone that said they were back here to do what they didn't do when they were here before. So do your hearts desire and do it now!"

When stationary, I enjoy playing in a garden, hiking in the woods or bicycling around town.  I also really enjoy throwing pottery and working with wood.

When traveling, I try to find the experiences most true to the place I am visiting.  I have lived by neighboring native communities in Peru, celebrated Mexican Independence Day with Viva Mexico!, and in my home country have visited many a small eating joint, community farm and local scenic view across the vast land of the United States.

When we're at home, you can find us watching cooking or nature shows on Netflix with our two cats.

I like to see the world through the lens of a local. I don't want to visit a new city and only see all the tourist spots; I want to see the hidden gems and waste no time finding the heart and soul of a city. I usually like to cap the trip with a nice dinner or some kind of show.
